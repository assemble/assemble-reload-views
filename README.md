# assemble-reload-views [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-reload-views.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-reload-views)

> Assemble instance plugin that reloads views when another plugin is loaded or options are updated.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i assemble-reload-views --save
```

## Usage

This initializes event listeners to listen for events that indicate if something needs to be re-initialized based on user options. The result is that views are reloaded whenever settings are changed.

```js
var reloadViews = require('assemble-reload-views');
var assemble = require('assemble');

var app = assemble();
app.use(reloadViews());
```
